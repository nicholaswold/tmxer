# tmxer

tmxer provides an abstraction over TMX files, particularly those generated by Tiled. The goal is to provide a clean base that any one can extend for their purposes. The library also has some extensions already built in, so that anyone using libraries like Pyglet can get started immediately.


## Requirements
  - Python 2.4+ (3+ also supported)
  - Any library you want to use with tmxer


## Licensing

A word about your right to use this library: I don't give a fuck. tmxer is licensed under the WTFPL. If you want to use this library in a game and make a million dollars, go right ahead. If you're particularly worried, make sure that any libraries you plan on using in conjunction with tmxer also DGAF.

If someone is willing to make a legal argument to me that I have violated the WTFPL or otherwise put developers in danger through the inclusion of some library, I'm more than willing to cut that out and put it in a branch not covered by the WTFPL.

Basically, have fun.


## Supported Libraries

This is a quick list of all the libraries tmxer currently has some sort of support for. You can also see it if you look five inches to the left, but what the hell. If you'd like to expand this list, see under Developer Guide.
